# TETRIS CLONE

## About
A Tetris clone written in C++ using SDL.

This project was partly for fun, and partly to learn more about SDL and game development in C++.

I aimed to stick to good object-oriented design principles, and the structure of the program is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model.
